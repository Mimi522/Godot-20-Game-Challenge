# Godot 20 Game Challenge
 
Starting the 20 Game Challenge recommended by Pirate Software. By the end of this challenge I hope to be more familiar and comfortable with Godot Engine.

## Game 1 - Pong
Traditional Pong arcade game. Good simple game to get introducted to Godot! Right...?

### What did I learn?
1. KinematicBody2D was renamed to CharacterBody2D, sure I guess? That was honestly confusing at first.
2. Collisions is, as always, a pain to deal with.
3. WorldBoundaryShape2D don't like being intercepted by another of the same type. No touchy allowed
4. I can actually change the script in the root of a packed scene, no need to make another scene just for that. In fact, I can go further and edit the child elements of it!!!
5. The pivots of UI elements don't behave as I would expect based on my experience with Unity.
